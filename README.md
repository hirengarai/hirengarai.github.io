# About me
------

I am Hirendra Kumar Garai, but you can call me *Hiren*.
I completed my PhD under [Dr. Sabyasachi Dey] in 2024.
My research? Cryptanalysis of symmetric ciphers – basically, I’m trying to outsmart secret codes. 
Currently I am a post-doctoral student in [CSE department] of [IIT Madras], where I am learning about quantum cryptanalysis post quantum schemes.
