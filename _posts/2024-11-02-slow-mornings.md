## the thought

It's harder than it sounds — waking up early, not checking the phone, sitting with a notebook and a problem.

## what works

- No screens for the first hour
- One focused task, nothing else
- Coffee helps (obviously)

## what doesn't

- Trying to do this every day (burnout is real)
- Being rigid about the routine
- Feeling guilty when it doesn't happen

## the point

Slow mornings aren't about productivity. They're about having space to think. Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not trying.
