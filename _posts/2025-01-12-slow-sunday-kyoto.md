## morning

Walked along the canal, coffee in hand, thinking about pace. The city moves differently here — slower, more deliberate. Every corner has a story, every alley a hidden shrine.

## afternoon

Bookstore stop, notes in the margin, no rush. Found a first edition of a math book I'd been hunting for years. The owner wrapped it in brown paper like it was something precious.

## snapshots

- tiny kissaten near the station
- the sound of bikes on wet pavement
- late light on old wood
- a cat sleeping on a temple step

## reflection

Sometimes the best days are the ones with no agenda. Just walking, watching, being present.
